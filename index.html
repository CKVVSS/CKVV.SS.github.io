        <h1 id="introduction">About</h1>
        <p>
            Vehicle Vision is one of the key gateways to artificial intelligence and a vital component of modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and plays an essential role in building humans' ability to experience the virtual world and understand the physics world in the Metaverse Intelligence. Currently, intelligent-vehicle visual computing systems are highly specialized and very limited in their ability to do traffic reasoning and causal inference. We need task-specific designs and large amounts of labeled training data for traffic model training. However, these models trained in this way still lack a general understanding of common sense that is obvious to the average adult and cannot describe the workings of our metaverse. Humans can thoroughly understand visual scenes because of priori knowledge from many domains and can learn and reason effectively based on their knowledge. To this end, the <span style="background: #00bfff; color: #fff; padding: 0 5px;">Computational Knowledge Vehicle Vision (a.k.a., vehicle vision-based computational knowledge), an advanced research that combines knowledge and intelligent vehicle based vision models is emerging</span>. This special session/issue solicits papers on approaches that address these challenges in computational knowledge vehicle vision; that is, approaches that can rapidly characterize, ratiocinate, and accommodate novelty from sudden and unannounced changes in the metaverse intelligence. In addition to work on new approaches, this special session/issue also accepts the special sources of computational knowledge, specialized methods for evaluating computational knowledge vehicle vision approaches, and theoretical frameworks for understanding metaverse intelligence. Of special interest are approaches that span both perception-oriented and cognition-oriented settings and that support both reactive and deliberative, both empirical and analytical, both psychological and philosophical behaviors.

            <b>Note that, we partnered with IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (T-IV), IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS), and 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2024) to avoid overlap and to ensure all special issues/sessions are complementary. The special session on ITSC 2024 emphasizes the innovative papers that open up new vistas for ITS/IV research and stimulate activity towards addressing new, long term challenges of interests. The special issue on T-ITS emphasizes the approaches and applications on large scale intelligent transportation systems. The special issue on T-IV emphasizes the methods and their evaluation/validation on intelligent vehicles. We will invite extended submissions of the best papers on ITSC 2024 to our T-ITS/T-TV Special Issue.</b>
